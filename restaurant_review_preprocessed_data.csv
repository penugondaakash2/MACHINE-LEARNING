The margarita was taking a while to arrive & instead of the cocktail they brought a Margherita pizza?! The cause of the misunderstanding was a 50/50, no blame given or taken, I accepted it. However, the waiter or manager or whoever it was, insisted that we pay for it. I wasn't prepared to argue about it but being a restaurant manager myself (in New Zealand) I certainly would never have made my customer pay for a messed up order. The guy seemed empowered by having asserted his will & point of view. Unfortunately he also succeeded in losing a customer for life.
